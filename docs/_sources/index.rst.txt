Support Vector Dynamics (svdynamics) is a lightweight, scikit-learn compatible
library for building and using mixed (composite) kernels for support vector
machines.

The goal of the project is to make kernel composition a first-class modeling
primitive, while remaining fully compatible with existing sklearn pipelines,
cross-validation, calibration and tooling.
